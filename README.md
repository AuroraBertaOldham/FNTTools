# FNTTools
## Introduction
FNTTools is a command line application for converting and inspecting [AngelCode bitmap fonts (.fnt)](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/). It is available for Windows (x86 and ARM), macOS (x86-64), and Linux (x86-64 and ARM). If you have any ideas for new functionality, please create an issue. I don't intend to add generating bitmap fonts, however. Check out my library [SharpFNT](https://github.com/AuroraBertaOldham/SharpFNT) to read and write AngelCode bitmap fonts in your own C# projects.

## Download
FNTTools can be downloaded from the releases section. The executables are self-contained so downloading the .NET Core runtime is unnecessary. A side effect of this however is that the executables have a file size of about 30-40MB.

## Changelog
Available [here](CHANGELOG.md).
