# FNTTools
## Introduction
FNTTools is a command line application for converting and analyzing Angel Code bitmap font files (.fnt). It is still a work in progress, but it should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you any ideas for new functionality, please create an issue. I don't intend to add generating bitmap fonts, however.
